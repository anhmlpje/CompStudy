          <p>Hideo Kojima (小島 秀夫, Kojima Hideo, born August 24, 1963) is a Japanese video game designer. 
            He is regarded as an auteur of video games. He developed a strong passion for film and 
            literature during his childhood and adolescence. In 1986, he was hired by Konami, 
            for which he designed and wrote Metal Gear (1987) for the MSX2, a game that laid the 
            foundations for stealth games and the Metal Gear series, his best known and most appreciated 
            works. At Konami, he also produced the Zone of the Enders series, as well as wrote and designed 
            Snatcher (1988) and Policenauts (1994), graphic adventure games regarded for their cinematic 
            presentation.<p>
            </p>
            Kojima founded Kojima Productions within Konami in 2005, and he was appointed vice 
            president of Konami Digital Entertainment in 2011. Kojima Productions split from Konami in 
            2015, becoming an independent studio. His studio's first game without Konami, Death Stranding, 
            was released in 2019.
